	<p><b>1.</b> Here in this file the "<b>home page</b>" aka header2 line<b>(color, background, font-size, border, margin)</b> is done by <b>inline css</b>, <b>internal css</b> and <b>external css</b> to assess the power of all the versions. The font & background color, font-size, border, margin came out as they're commanded in <b>inline css</b> instead of the other two css proves that it is the most powerful out of the 3 css, though the best and standard one is external css.</p>
	
	<p><b>2.</b> The <b>"I'm shafayat mugdho"</b> aka h2 line is implemented by both <b>internal css</b> and <b>external css</b> but the font color came out to be <b>skyblue</b> and the border came out to be <b>solid</b> instead of pink and dotted which was commanded through <b>external css</b> proving <b>internal css</b>'s supremacy over <b>external css</b> in term of power.</p>
	
	<p><b>3.</b> Header3 is designed(I know, "designed" right? heh) by only <b> internal css</b>.</p>
	
	<p><b>4.</b> Header4 has 3 lines with same tag but different <b>classes</b> and <b>ids</b>. They are done in <b>external css</b> by calling their <b>tag</b> <b>class</b> and <b>id</b> names respectively and indivisually. And the result shows that <b>id</b> is superior than both <b>class & tag</b> with <b>class</b> securing the second position in terms of power.</p>
	
	<p><b>5.</b> beside the 2nd picture 4 <b>links</b> are shown as "About"<b>(internal link)</b>, "my fb profile"<b>(external link)</b>, "my cv"<b>(internal link)</b> and "client"<b>(missing link)</b>. They respectably linked the Home page with About page <b>(target="self")</b>, my fb account<b>(target="_blank")</b>, my CV<b>(target="_blank")</b> and nowhere<b>(href="#" target="_blank")</b></p> 



	<p><b>6.</b> Now we'll check the <b>measurement unit</b> below:</p>

	<div class="px"></div>
	
	<div class="pt"></div>

	<div class="em"></div>

	<div class="percent"></div>


	<p> Above we can see 4 colored square<br>the <b>red</b> one is the measurement of <b>100px</b><br>the <b>green</b> one is the measurement of <b>100pt</b><br>the <b>blue</b> one is the measurement of <b>10em</b><br>and the <b>yellow</b> one is the measurement of <b>10%</b><br>with each of their height being the same size of <b>100px</b>


	<p><b>7.</b> now we'll see color code"</p>

	<div class="px2"></div>
	
	<div class="pt2"></div>

	<div class="em2"></div>

	<div class="percent2"></div>


	<p> Above we can again see 4 colored square. But this time we used <abbr title="red green blue"><b>rgb</b></abbr> color code instead of solid color<br>The color code of the first square is #a1b2c3<br>The color code of second box is #e9d8c7<br>The color code of the third box is #1a2a3a<br>And the color code of box number 4 is #9a8b7c

	
	<p><b>8.</b>now we'll see the use of <b>rgba</b> (opacity check)</p>

	
	<h5 style="color: red; font-size: 25px;">now you see me</h5>

	<div class="rgbacheck"></div>

	<p>Above, we're able to see the sentence under or behind the rectangle only because the oapacity/rgba of the rectangle was lowered to a state where it is opaque enough to let us see what's behind it. this is the work of <b>rgba</b><br>the rgba color code of this rectangle is <b>rgba(00,00,00,0.3)</b></p>
